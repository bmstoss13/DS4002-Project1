Project 1 for DS4002

Our project cleans and preprocesses the textual data, then uses three algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees) to identify emails as spam or not spam. It then compares each model performance based on precision and accuracy levels to determine the highest performing algorithm in detecting spam email. 

Installation/Building (H2)


Show the actual commands I have to type to build the project, including fetching dependencies. Use Markdown triple-backticks ("```") to show commands in code style.

Usage (H2)

If it's a command-line app, list the available invocations (e.g. git revert, git commit, etc.). If it's a web app, list the URLS.

Notes (H2)

This is where you talk about your design ideas: algorithms, papers you've read, goals, TODO items.
